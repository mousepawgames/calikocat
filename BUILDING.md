# Building CalikoCat

## Building Basics

CMake is used to build CalikoCat and CalikoCat Tester. For your convenience,
we've included Makefiles to automate all common build scenarios on Linux.
Type "make" in the root of this repository for more information.

At this time, the Makefiles are only designed for Linux. If you are building
on another system, you can interact with CMake directly.

Currently, CalikoCat is only designed to be built by GCC (5.3 or later) or
Clang (3.4 or later).

## Building and Linking Dependencies

CalikoCat relies on CPGF, PawLIB, and Eigen. The default behavior of the build
system is to look for MousePaw Games' `libdeps/` and `pawlib/` repositories,
cloned parallel to this repository's main folder. Simply run `make ready` in
each of those repositories before building this one. (This is our default for
company development environments.)

You can specify custom paths for these libraries by creating a ".config" file
in the root of this repository. Make a copy of "build.config.txt" and save it
with the ending ".config". See that file for more information.

## Ready-To-Use Build

If you just want to build CalikoCat to use in your own project, the fastest way
is to run "make ready". This will build CalikoCat and place it in a folder
called `calikocat`, then point your compiler and linker to "calikocat/include"
and "calikocat/lib" respectively. Our other repositories point to this by
default.

## Building HTML Docs

If you want the HTML documentation, run "make docs". Then, grab the
'docs/build/html' folder, or just open 'docs/build/html/index.html' in
your favorite web browser.

## Building Tester

If you want to test out CalikoCat directly, run "make tester". Then, look
for the 'calikocat-tester' executable in 'calikocat-tester/bin/[Debug/Release]'.
Alternatively, you may use the symbolic link 'tester' or 'tester_debug'
in the root of this repository.

## Code::Blocks

CalikoCat was written and built in CodeBlocks. The projects (.cbp) in this
repository are pre-configured to build directly in the repository.

## Source Directories

- The '/docs' folder contains the Sphinx documentation for CalikoCat.
- The '/calikocat-source' folder contains the source code for the CalikoCat
  library.
- The '/calikocat-tester' folder contains the console application for testing
  the CalikoCat library.
